While reasonable effort has been made to ensure this GIS data set accurately reflects the approved list, if discrepancies are found, the water body information in the .pdf documents mentioned below are to be considered official and supercede the GIS data set.On November 11, 2010, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division's Year 2010 Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Draft Report (also referred to as Water Quality in Georgia 2008-2009) and lists were approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA). The final and official, approved lists of water body classifications for Rivers/Streams, Lakes/Reservoirs, Coastal Streams, Coastal Beaches, and Sounds/Harbors can be found in .pdf format at http://www.georgiaepd.org/Documents/305b.html and in the compressed .zip with this GIS data set.This GIS data set represents the State of Georgia 2008-2009 assessment of water quality and resulting Year 2010 305(b)/303(d) list of waters prepared in response to Sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the Clean Water Act and in accordance with the USEPA implementing regulations and guidance. Assessed water bodies are classified as assessment pending for, supporting or not supporting their designated uses according to a comparison of water quality monitoring results to water quality standards and other pertinent information.This GIS data set is an ESRI polygon shapefile representing Year 2010 305(b)/303(d) listed Lakes, Sounds, and Harbors areas at a scale of 1:100,000 in Geographic North American Datum 1983 (NAD83). The majority of the GIS data set is based on previous Georgia EPD GIS shapefiles for the 305(b)/303(d) List for the Years 2008, 2006, 2004, 2002, and 2000. The GIS data set for Year 2010 305(b)/303(d) list has been significantly expanded and improved over previous years GIS shapefiles. All new Lakes, Sounds, and Harbors segments have been created using the National Hydrography Dataset(NHD) Medium Resolution geodatabase feature class. Harbors were created by Georgia DNR Coastal Resource Division using aerial photography and color IR DOQQs.When using this GIS dataset, the polygons represent the area of the listed water body within the state of Georgia. The associated attribute table includes all fields and information within the 305(b)/303(d) list that corresponds to the GIS polygon in addition to USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 8 and 10.</abstract><purpose>The purpose of this GIS data set and associated information is to show and describe the extent of the waters in Georgia where water quality standards have assessment pending or has been assessed, and waters are listed as either supporting or not fully supporting their designated uses according to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) 305(b) and 303(d) federal Clean Water Act guidelines. The Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Report and supporting GIS data set are produced by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (EPD) every two years.


The GIS data set contains two feature classes: polyline feature class represents streams, coastal streams, and coastal beaches and the polygon feature class represents lakes, sounds, and harbors. Both feature classes should be used together to accurately show all waterbodies assessed for 305(b) and 303(d) guidelines. 


This spatial data set is an ESRI polygon shapefile representing lakes, sounds, and harbors. Attribute information includes reach ID, water body reach name, reach location, major basin name, criterion violated, potential causes, data source, county, water body type, water uses classification, evaluation, category tier, water body extent, extent units, priority year, notes, HUC 8, and HUC 10.</purpose><supplinf>The source for the information in this data set comes from the Year 2010 Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Report, prepared by Georgia EPD. The list is prepared in response to sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act and in accordance with USEPA implementing regulations and guidance.

Section 305(b) requires that each State prepare and submit to the Administrator of the USEPA a biennial report, which describes water quality conditions of navigable waters across the State. The USEPA provides guidance to the States to establish a framework for consistent reporting across the nation. This report provides an assessment of the water quality conditions in Georgia and includes a description of the nature, extent, and causes of documented water quality problems.

Section 303(d) requires that each State identify those waters within its boundaries for which effluent limitations required by Section 301(b)(1)(A) and Section 301(b)(1)(B) are not stringent enough to implement any water quality standard applicable to such waters. States are then required to establish a total maximum daily load for each pollutant at such a level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standard. Georgia's 305(b)/303(d) list is published biennially as part of the larger publication entitled "Water Quality In Georgia". The 2010 list appears in the 2008 - 2009 edition and is available on http://www.gaepd.com/Documents/305b.html.</supplinf><langdata Sync="TRUE">en</langdata></descript><timeperd><timeinfo><sngdate><caldate>2001 - 2010</caldate></sngdate></timeinfo><current>publication date</current></timeperd><status><progress>Complete</progress><update>Biennial</update></status><spdom><bounding><westbc Sync="TRUE">-85.337910</westbc><eastbc Sync="TRUE">-80.927950</eastbc><northbc Sync="TRUE">34.987670</northbc><southbc Sync="TRUE">30.709740</southbc></bounding><lboundng><leftbc Sync="TRUE">-85.337910</leftbc><rightbc Sync="TRUE">-80.927950</rightbc><bottombc Sync="TRUE">30.709740</bottombc><topbc Sync="TRUE">34.987670</topbc></lboundng></spdom><keywords><theme><themekt>Georgia Environmental Protection Division, Watershed Protection Branch.</themekt><themekey>Georgia</themekey><themekey>Georgia Environmental Protection Division</themekey><themekey>environment</themekey><themekey>USEPA</themekey><themekey>water quality assessment</themekey><themekey>water quality standards</themekey><themekey>303(d)</themekey><themekey>305(b)</themekey><themekey>Total Maximum Daily Load</themekey></theme><place><placekey>Georgia</placekey><placekey>USEPA Region 4</placekey><placekey>Southeast</placekey></place><temporal><tempkey>2010</tempkey></temporal></keywords><accconst>The Georgia Environmental Protection Division - Watershed Protection Branch should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.</accconst><useconst>This ESRI GIS data set is based on the descriptive locations of the listed water bodies within the Year 2010 Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Report, however, it should not be considered as Georgia's approved list.

The State of Georgia 2000 305(b)/303(d) List map was developed from an earlier map created by the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Spatial Analysis and Technology (see source citation for DNR305b Stream Reaches).

Modifications were made by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD) to the existing map to create a new map from which the Georgia 305(b) Water Quality Assessment for the Year 2000 map was developed. Modifications included:

Stream reaches not having an assessment designation of supporting, partially supporting, or not supporting (not evaluated) were deleted from the spatial database.

Multiple DLG stream segments representing a single 305(b) listed stream reach were combined into a single stream segment to reduce the size of the database and improve its utility.

All listed stream reaches depicted using a left and right edge of water were represented by a single segment corresponding to one of the edges or the centerline.

Water bodies such as lakes and estuaries represented by polygonal entities were added to the coverage. The polygons were converted to lines in order for them to reside in the same ArcView line theme as the stream reaches.

The database field structure was modified to correspond more closely to the 305(b)/303(d) list. After modifying the original map, stream reaches were added to the modified map to reflect the current 2000 305(b) list of waters. Stream reaches were added using the following methods:

305(b) stream reaches were identified and located using location description information as well as available marked Georgia Department of Transportation county road paper maps.

Using the stream reach location, a line entity was added to the 305(b) map. In cases where there were DLG segments to represent the 305(b) stream reach, these line segments were directly transferred from the DLG coverage to the 305(b) map coverage, and multiple DLG segments were combined into one segment representing the 305(b) reach. In cases where DLG segments were not available to represent the stream reach, primarily in cases of smaller streams, the stream reach was digitized into the map in the approximate location identified.

For water bodies such as lakes and estuaries, DLG segments were used, when available, to define the boundaries of water bodies. In some instances, particularly estuaries, when DLG segments were not available to define the water body boundary, an ellipse was placed in the approximate location of the listed water bodies.

The work performed to modify and update the original map was done using MapInfo software. The final map was converted from the MapInfo file format to the ArcView shapefile format using MapInfo?s Universal Translator software.

For database management purposes unique reach identifiers were assigned to each 305(b) listed water bodies according to the 10-digit hydrologic unit containing the downstream limit of the segment.

The 305(b) map coverage database was checked against Georgia's published water quality assessment 305(b) list for the year 2000. For some listed waters the Actions to Alleviate database field has been truncated due to ArcView 3.x 254 character field length limit.</procdesc><procdate>December 2000</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>305(b) Coordinator</cntper><cntorg>Georgia Environmental Protection Division - Watershed Protection Branch</cntorg></cntperp><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing and physical address</addrtype><address>4220 International Parkway, Suite 101</address><city>Atlanta</city><state>Georgia</state><postal>30354</postal><country>USA</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>404-675-6236</cntvoice><cntfax>404-675-6244</cntfax><hours>8:00 am to 4:30 pm</hours></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Process Step 2: Creation of Georgia's 2002 305(b)/303(d) List Map

The process of creating the 2002 List map consisted largely of modifying the 2000 list polyline coverage and attribute table to concur with the new 2002 305(b)/303(d) list document. Significant addition of water body reaches was accomplished using the same methods and software outlined in the 2000 list process.  Some reach segments, which did not appear on 1:100,000 hydrology coverage, were drawn in estimated locations.

The process consisted largely of modifying the 2006 list polyline data set and attribute table to concur with the new 2008 305(b)/303(d) list document for coastal streams, coastal beaches, and streams. Also a separate polygon dataset was developed for lakes, sounds and harbors.  Significant additions of water body reaches and updates of attributes were accomplished using the same methods outlined in the 2000 list process, however, all new lakes were added using the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Medium Resolution as source GIS data.  Sounds and harbors were created by Georgia DNR Coastal Resource Division using aerial photography and color IR DOQQs.

assessment pending or has been assessed, and waters are listed as either supporting or not fully supporting their designated uses according to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) 305(b) and 303(d) federal Clean Water Act guidelines. The Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Report and supporting GIS data set are produced by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (EPD) every two years.


The GIS data set contains two feature classes: polyline feature class represents streams, coastal streams, and coastal beaches and the polygon feature class represents lakes, sounds, and harbors. Both feature classes should be used together to accurately show all waterbodies assessed for 305(b) and 303(d) guidelines. 


This spatial data set is an ESRI polygon shapefile representing lakes, sounds, and harbors. Attribute information includes reach ID, water body reach name, reach location, major basin name, criterion violated, potential causes, data source, county, water body type, water uses classification, evaluation, category tier, water body extent, extent units, priority year, notes, HUC 8, and HUC 10.</idPurp><idAbs>&lt;DIV STYLE="text-align:Left;"&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN STYLE="font-weight:bold;"&gt;NOTICE: &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This ESRI GIS data set is based on the descriptive locations of the listed water bodies within the Year 2010 Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Report, however, it should not be considered as Georgia's approved list. While reasonable effort has been made to ensure this GIS data set accurately reflects the approved list, if discrepancies are found, the water body information in the .pdf documents mentioned below are to be considered official and supercede the GIS data set.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;On November 11, 2010, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division's Year 2010 Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Draft Report (also referred to as Water Quality in Georgia 2008-2009) and lists were approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA). The final and official, approved lists of water body classifications for Rivers/Streams, Lakes/Reservoirs, Coastal Streams, Coastal Beaches, and Sounds/Harbors can be found in .pdf format at http://www.georgiaepd.org/Documents/305b.html and in the compressed .zip with this GIS data set.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This GIS data set represents the State of Georgia 2008-2009 assessment of water quality and resulting Year 2010 305(b)/303(d) list of waters prepared in response to Sections 305(b) and 303(d) of the Clean Water Act and in accordance with the USEPA implementing regulations and guidance. Assessed water bodies are classified as assessment pending for, supporting or not supporting their designated uses according to a comparison of water quality monitoring results to water quality standards and other pertinent information.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;This GIS data set is an ESRI polygon shapefile representing Year 2010 305(b)/303(d) listed Lakes, Sounds, and Harbors areas at a scale of 1:100,000 in Geographic North American Datum 1983 (NAD83). The majority of the GIS data set is based on previous Georgia EPD GIS shapefiles for the 305(b)/303(d) List for the Years 2008, 2006, 2004, 2002, and 2000. The GIS data set for Year 2010 305(b)/303(d) list has been significantly expanded and improved over previous years GIS shapefiles. All new Lakes, Sounds, and Harbors segments have been created using the National Hydrography Dataset(NHD) Medium Resolution geodatabase feature class. Harbors were created by Georgia DNR Coastal Resource Division using aerial photography and color IR DOQQs.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;When using this GIS dataset, the polygons represent the area of the listed water body within the state of Georgia.

AooooAKKKKAP/9k=</Data></Thumbnail></Binary><dqInfo><dataLineage><prcStep xmlns=""><stepDesc>Step 1: Creation of  Georgia 2000 305(b)/303(d) List Map The State of Georgia 2000 305(b)/303(d) List map was developed from an earlier map created by the U.S. Geological Survey Center for Spatial Analysis and Technology (see source citation for DNR305b Stream Reaches). Modifications were made by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division (GAEPD) to the existing map to create a new map from which the Georgia 305(b) Water Quality Assessment for the Year 2000 map was developed. Modifications included: Stream reaches not having an assessment designation of supporting, partially supporting, or not supporting (not evaluated) were deleted from the spatial database. Multiple DLG stream segments representing a single 305(b) listed stream reach were combined into a single stream segment to reduce the size of the database and improve its utility. All listed stream reaches depicted using a left and right edge of water were represented by a single segment corresponding to one of the edges or the centerline. Water bodies such as lakes and estuaries represented by polygonal entities were added to the coverage. The polygons were converted to lines in order for them to reside in the same ArcView line theme as the stream reaches. The database field structure was modified to correspond more closely to the 305(b)/303(d) list. After modifying the original map, stream reaches were added to the modified map to reflect the current 2000 305(b) list of waters. Stream reaches were added using the following methods: 305(b) stream reaches were identified and located using location description information as well as available marked Georgia Department of Transportation county road paper maps. Using the stream reach location, a line entity was added to the 305(b) map. In cases where there were DLG segments to represent the 305(b) stream reach, these line segments were directly transferred from the DLG coverage to the 305(b) map coverage, and multiple DLG segments were combined into one segment representing the 305(b) reach. In cases where DLG segments were not available to represent the stream reach, primarily in cases of smaller streams, the stream reach was digitized into the map in the approximate location identified. For water bodies such as lakes and estuaries, DLG segments were used, when available, to define the boundaries of water bodies. In some instances, particularly estuaries, when DLG segments were not available to define the water body boundary, an ellipse was placed in the approximate location of the listed water bodies. The work performed to modify and update the original map was done using MapInfo software. The final map was converted from the MapInfo file format to the ArcView shapefile format using MapInfo?s Universal Translator software. For database management purposes unique reach identifiers were assigned to each 305(b) listed water bodies according to the 10-digit hydrologic unit containing the downstream limit of the segment. The 305(b) map coverage database was checked against Georgia's published water quality assessment 305(b) list for the year 2000. For some listed waters the Actions to Alleviate database field has been truncated due to ArcView 3.x 254 character field length limit.

The process consisted largely of modifying the 2006 list polyline data set and attribute table to concur with the new 2008 305(b)/303(d) list document for coastal streams, coastal beaches, and streams. Also a separate polygon dataset was developed for lakes, sounds and harbors. Significant additions of water body reaches and updates of attributes were accomplished using the same methods outlined in the 2000 list process, however, all new lakes were added using the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) Medium Resolution as source GIS data. Sounds and harbors were created by Georgia DNR Coastal Resource Division using aerial photography and color IR DOQQs.
