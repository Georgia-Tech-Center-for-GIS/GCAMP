DataLayer,Description
Aids to navigation,"Structures intended to assist a navigator to determine position or safe course, or to warn of dangers or obstructions to navigation. This dataset includes lights, signals, buoys, day beacons, and other aids to navigation. These data are intended for coastal and ocean use planning."
Armored Shore,"Armoring of the shoreline prohibits intertidal environments from migrating inland and encroaching onto existing uplands as sea level rises. While armoring protects upland property, it leads to degradation of intertidal ecosystems. Knowing the distribution of armored shorelines is a first step in addressing their impacts on the preservation of estuarine systems. This project maps the location of armored shorelines in the estuarine area of Georgia (defined as that region from the COLREGS limits in the sounds to Highway 17 or Interstate 95, whichever is farther west) and identifies the type of shoreline stabilization (i.e., seawall, revetment and other stabilization methods.)"
Causeways,"Causeways prohibit intertidal environments. While causeways allow access, the lead to degradation of intertidal ecosystems. Knowing the distribution of causeways is a first step in addressing their impacts on the preservation of estuarine systems. This project maps the location of causeways in the estuarine area of Georgia (defined as that region from the COLREGS limits in the sounds to Highway 17 or Interstate 95, whichever is farther west)."
Coastal Water Access Points,"The water access feature class was created to document publically accessible fishing and boating access sites within the eleven coastal counties of Georgia including Chatham, Effingham, Bryan, Liberty, Long, McIntosh, Glynn, Wayne, Charlton, Brantley, and Camden Counties. Access sites and information were collected from CRD shapefiles, Shawn Jordan at DNR Coastal Resources Division, The University of Georgia Marine Extension's ""A Visitor's Guide to Accessing Georgia's Coastal Resources"" and their ""Guide to Coastal Fishing in Georgia"" maps, Sites that were verified are denoted by date in the ""Verified"" field of the Attribute Table. Facilities that were known to be private, membership only, or otherwise excluded public access were not listed at the time of creation. Point location was placed approximately at the upland interface with the marsh or water. The points were verified at a 1:1000 scale using 2010 National Agriculture Imagery Program aerial images. Photographs linked to the files were taken on land by CRD Staff, provided by Shawn Jordan, or captured through available high resolution imagery. "

Shipping Fairways,"Various shipping zones delineating the activities of and regulations for marine vessel traffic. Traffic lanes define specific traffic flow, while traffic separation zones assist opposing streams of marine traffic. Precautionary areas represent areas where ships must navigate with caution, and shipping safety fairways designate where artificial structures are prohibited. Along certain zones of the East Coast of the United States, ships are also required to report vessel location within designated endangered species areas, such as the North Atlantic right whale."
Sunken Vessels,"The purpose of this dataset is to show the extent and location of abandoned vessels in Coastal Georgia waters.  Georgia DNR Coastal Resources Division staff obtained coordinates of the sunken vessels through field location and marked points using a GeoXH 2005 Series Pocket PC.  Coordinates were taken from the deck of the vessel where possible.  For additional information please contact Charles ""Buck"" Bennett at (912)264-7218."
Swimming Beaches,The purpose of this dataset is to show Georgia recreational swimming beaches where adjacent waters undergo bateriological sampling and analysis.  The Georgia Department of Natural Resources Coastal Resources Division is responible for monitoring.  More information can be found online at www.CoastalGADNR.org or http://water.epa.gov/type/oceb/beaches/beaches_index.cfm  
Unexploded areas,"Unexploded ordnance (or UXOs/UXBs, sometimes identified as UO) are explosive weapons (bombs, bullets, shells, grenades, land mines, naval mines, etc.) that did not explode when they were employed and still pose a risk of detonation, potentially many decades after they were used or discarded. While “UXO” is widely and informally used, munitions and explosives of concern (MEC) is the current preferred terminology within the remediation community. This is NOT a complete collection of unexploded ordnance on the seafloor, nor are the locations to be considered exact. The presence and locations of the unexploded ordnance have been derived from graphical representations recorded on NOAA Raster Navigation Charts. These data are intended for coastal and ocean planning."

OCS Blocks,"Outer Continental Shelf Lease Blocks are used to assist in leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. Blocks are numbered areas depicted on the OPDs or Leasing Maps. Most are of a uniform size according to the projection and type of map on which they are depicted, but many are of non-uniform size and shape due to their proximity to an adjacent map, projection zone, or boundary. Blocks should always be referred to with their parent protraction name or number since block numbers repeat from one protraction to the next."
OCS Boundary,"Official Protraction Diagrams (OPDs) are drawings showing subdivisions of the OCS intended for leasing purposes and depict all the related OCS blocks. OPDs are named for the most prominent geographic feature within the protraction and by the United Nations International Map Numbering System. Protractions in the middle latitudes are 2 degrees longitude by 1 degree latitude. In the Gulf of Mexico, similar maps known as Leasing Maps exist off the coast of TX and LA and are also made available as part of this map layer."
OCS Protraction Diagrams,
Shellfish Growing Areas,"The Coastal Resources Division currently monitors and maintains five shellfish growing areas comprised of commercial leases and public recreational harvest areas. Shellfish waters on the Georgia coast are classified as “Approved"" or “Prohibited"" in accordance with the criteria of the National Shellfish Sanitation Program. Specific zones within shellfish growing areas may be closed to shell fishing because of the proximity to a marina or a municipal or industrial discharge.  Georgia maintains approximately 33,000 acres approved for the harvest of shellfish for commercial and/or personal consumption. Only those areas designated as Public Recreational Harvest or those areas under commercial lease are classified as ""Approved for shellfish harvest"".  Shellfish growing area waters are monitored regularly to ensure that these areas remain in compliance with the FDA fecal coliform thresholds.  All other waters of the state are classified as ""Prohibited"", and are closed to the taking of shellfish. It is important to note that, even though some of these areas could potentially meet the criteria to allow for harvesting, they have been classified as “Prohibited"" due to the lack of available water quality data.  Please contact the GADNR Coastal Resources Division Shellfish Program for the most current version of this layer."

Conservation managers and biologists may use these data to assist in making management decisions as well as prioritizing lands for conservation. Ultimately, these data will help local governments in planning and making land use decisions."
Habitat of particular concern,"The purpose of HAPCs is to focus conservation, management, and research efforts on subsets of EFH that are vulnerable to degradation or are especially important ecologically for federally managed fish. The HAPC designation alone does not confer additional protection or restrictions to an area, but helps to focus EFH conservation, management, and research priorities. HAPC designation is a valuable way to acknowledge areas where we have detailed information on ecological function and habitat vulnerability, indicating a greater need for conservation and management. In some instances the Councils and NMFS may develop fishery management measures to conserve the habitat within the HAPC.HAPCs are a subset of EFH that deserve special attention because they provide extremely important ecological functions and/or are especially vulnerable to degradation. For instance, HAPC designation may be warranted for areas that play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of a managed species (e.g., grouper spawning sites) or areas that contain a rare habitat type (e.g., corals) that may be sensitive to disturbance from fishing or other human activities.Councils may designate an area as a HAPC for one or more of the following reasons:The habitat provides important ecological functionsThe habitat is sensitive to human-induced environmental degradationDevelopment activities are, or will be, stressing the habitatThe habitat type is rare."
InshoreOffshoreReefs,
Listed Waters (305b/303d),"The purpose of this GIS data set and associated information is to show and describe the extent of the waters in Georgia where water quality standards have assessment pending or has been assessed, and waters are listed as either supporting or not fully supporting their designated uses according to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) 305(b) and 303(d) federal Clean Water Act guidelines. The Integrated 305(b)/303(d) Report and supporting GIS data set are produced by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Environmental Protection Division (EPD) every two years. The GIS data set contains two feature classes: polyline feature class represents streams, coastal streams, and coastal beaches and the polygon feature class represents lakes, sounds, and harbors. Both feature classes should be used together to accurately show all waterbodies assessed for 305(b) and 303(d) guidelines. This spatial data set is an ESRI polyline shapefile representing streams, coastal streams, and coastal beaches. Attribute information includes reach ID, stream reach name, reach location, major basin name, criterion violated, potential causes, data source, county, water body type, water uses classification, evaluation, category tier, stream extent, beach extent, extent units, priority year, notes, HUC 8, and HUC 10"
NWIPlus2011,"The NWIPlus created additional descriptors for landscape position, landform, water flow path, and waterbody type (LLWW descriptors) to expand wetland classification. The enhanced classification, referred to as NWIPlus allowed for more detailed classification of types that could be used to perform a preliminary assessment of functions for wetlands in the region."
State Priority Habitat (detailed extent),"These data can be used in multiple applications, but were created to assist in tracking the location and extent of natural communities on the coast of Georgia. Conservation managers and biologists may use these data to assist in making management decisions as well as prioritizing lands for conservation. Ultimately, these data will help local governments in planning and making land use decisions."

DEM,"This data represent bare earth elevation information for coastal Georgia.  LiDAR based Digital Elevation Models (DEM) were derived from various sources including the Coastal Georgia Elevation Project, Liberty County, Chatham County, and Glynn County.  The DEMs were mosaicked together and resampled. Additional information and individual datasets can be obtained at http://www.csc.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/data/coastallidar/index.html  "
Georgia Shoreline,These data were automated to provide a suitable geographic information system (GIS) data layer depicting the historical shoreline for Georgia. These data are derived from shoreline maps that were produced by the NOAA National Ocean Service including its predecessor agencies.
Landcover,"This vegetation map was created using the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (USNVC), with alliance and association as base map units. Plot data were used to determine classification and assisted in establishing reference 'signatures' for mapping. Color infrared aerial photography from 1999, sets of true color aerial photography from 2005-2009 (1:3000 scale) and black and white 1947 and 1988 imagery were used for mapping. Polygons were drawn on-screen (heads-up digitizing). One hundred landcover categories were mapped. Of these 100 categories, classification using the USNVC resulted in 20 ecological systems, 57 alliances, and 85 associations."
Maximum Tidal Current,Data depicts tidal stream maximum current within U.S. waters.
Maximum Tidal Power,"Data depicts tidal stream maximum power within U.S. waters. Tidal streams are high velocity sea currents created by periodic horizontal movement of the tides. Tidal stream energy is derived from the kinetic energy of the moving flow. A numerical model was used for simulating the tidal flows along the coast of the entire United States. Model results were calibrated with available measurements of tidal currents from NOAA tidal current stations. It should be noted that tidal currents and associated power per unit area can have significant spatial variability; therefore currents at one location are generally a poor indicator of conditions at another location, even nearby. Tidal power (energy) is measured in watts per meter squared (W/m2) and was classified using quantiles."
